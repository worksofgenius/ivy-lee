## General info
### The Ivy Lee Method
Ivy Lee followed a daily routine for achieving peak productivity:
1. At the end of each work day, write down the six most important tasks to accomplish the next day.
2. Prioritize those six tasks in order of their importance.
3. The next day, concentrate only on the first task. Work until the first task is finished before moving on to the second task.
4. At the end of the day, move any unfinished items to a new list of six tasks for the following day.
5. Repeat every working day.

This app offers a simple way to keep track of your daily routine.
